A simple command-line interface (CLI) application written in Python that gathers basic user information and displays a friendly, personalized summary.

---

### 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental Python skills, specifically:
* Using the built-in `input()` function for data collection.
* Storing data in **variables**.
* Using the `print()` function, particularly with **f-strings**, to create formatted and dynamic output.

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### 📋 Prerequisites

You need a standard Python interpreter installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).

#### 💻 Installation and Execution

1.  **Save the file:** Ensure your Python code is saved as `personal_intro.py`.
2.  **Run the program:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the file's directory, and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python personal_intro.py
    ```

### ✨ Program Flow

The script will prompt you for five pieces of information:

1.  Name
2.  Age
3.  Favorite Hobby
4.  Favorite Color
5.  Current City

After gathering all the inputs, it generates and displays a warm, formatted summary of your details.

### 🛠️ Dependencies

This project uses only **standard Python library features** and requires no external packages.
